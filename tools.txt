What is the difference b/w git pull, git push, git fetch & git clone?   
    Git pull brings changes in the code to the local repository and workingArea 
    Git fetch brings changes to the code in the local repository ONLY.

  which can be merge after review [git diff]    
    Git push brings changes in the code to the remote/shared repository from LocalRepo 
    Git clone brings the entire code to the Local Repo/environment
